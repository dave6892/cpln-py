# Revised Container Model Implementation Issues

Based on the OpenAPI specification analysis, here are the revised, more realistic GitHub issues:

## Issue 1: Implement Container Information Model
**Title**: Create Container data model and basic information retrieval from workload deployments

**Description**:
Create a `Container` class that represents container information extracted from workload deployment data. Since the Control Plane API doesn't expose direct container endpoints, containers are accessed through workload deployment status.

**Scope**:
- Create `Container` data class with properties extracted from deployment status
- Implement method to parse container data from deployment versions
- Add container information extraction from job executions
- Include container metadata like status, image, resource usage

**API Endpoints Used**:
- `GET /org/{org}/gvc/{gvc}/workload/{workload}/deployment/{name}`

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] `Container` class created with appropriate properties
- [ ] Container data can be extracted from deployment status
- [ ] Container information includes: name, image, status, resource info
- [ ] Unit tests cover container data parsing
- [ ] Documentation explains container data limitations

## Issue 2: Implement Container Listing from Workload Deployments
**Title**: Add functionality to list containers across workloads in a GVC

**Description**:
Implement functionality to discover and list all containers by iterating through workloads and their deployments within a GVC. Since containers aren't directly exposed, this requires aggregating data from multiple workload deployments.

**Scope**:
- Add method to list all workloads in a GVC
- Extract container information from each workload's deployments
- Aggregate containers across multiple workloads
- Handle pagination and filtering

**API Endpoints Used**:
- `GET /org/{org}/gvc/{gvc}/workload` (list workloads)
- `GET /org/{org}/gvc/{gvc}/workload/{workload}/deployment` (get deployment info)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Method to list containers across all workloads in a GVC
- [ ] Filtering options (by workload, status, etc.)
- [ ] Proper error handling for missing deployments
- [ ] Performance considerations for multiple API calls
- [ ] Unit and integration tests

## Issue 3: Add Container Status and Health Information
**Title**: Enhance Container model with deployment status and health indicators

**Description**:
Extend the Container model to include detailed status information derived from workload deployment data, including health status, readiness, and deployment version information.

**Scope**:
- Add status properties to Container class
- Include deployment version tracking
- Add health and readiness indicators
- Include resource utilization where available

**Dependencies**: Issue 1 (Container Information Model)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Container status reflects deployment state
- [ ] Health information included when available
- [ ] Version tracking for container deployments
- [ ] Clear documentation of status meanings
- [ ] Tests for various status scenarios

## Issue 4: Implement Container Search and Filtering
**Title**: Add advanced filtering and search capabilities for containers

**Description**:
Implement filtering and search functionality for containers based on various criteria like workload name, image, status, and metadata.

**Scope**:
- Filter by workload name/pattern
- Filter by container image
- Filter by deployment status
- Search by labels/metadata
- Combine multiple filter criteria

**Dependencies**: Issue 2 (Container Listing)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Multiple filtering options implemented
- [ ] Efficient filtering without excessive API calls
- [ ] Support for regex/pattern matching
- [ ] Clear filter documentation
- [ ] Performance tests for large result sets

---

## Issue 5: Add Documentation and Examples for Container Operations
**Title**: Create comprehensive documentation and usage examples

**Description**:
Create documentation explaining the Container model limitations, usage patterns, and provide practical examples for common use cases.

**Scope**:
- Document API limitations regarding containers
- Provide usage examples for container listing
- Explain relationship between containers and workloads
- Add troubleshooting guide
- Include performance considerations

**Dependencies**: Issues 1-4

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] README section for Container usage
- [ ] Code examples for common operations
- [ ] API limitation documentation
- [ ] Performance best practices
- [ ] Integration with existing SDK documentation

---

## Issue 6: Add Container Integration Tests
**Title**: Create comprehensive integration tests for Container functionality

**Description**:
Develop integration tests that validate Container functionality against real Control Plane environments, ensuring the container data extraction works correctly across different workload configurations.

**Scope**:
- Integration tests with real API
- Test various workload types (serverless, standard, jobs)
- Test error conditions and edge cases
- Performance testing for large deployments
- Mock test environments

**Dependencies**: Issues 1-4

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Integration tests for all container operations
- [ ] Tests cover different workload types
- [ ] Error condition testing
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] CI/CD integration
